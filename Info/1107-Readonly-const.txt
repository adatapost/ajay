const and readonly keywords
================================================
The "const" creates constant at the time of compilation where as
"readonly" creates constant fields at the time of execuction of program -- especially after the execution of "constructor" of that class.

Fields or local variables declared as "const" cannot use "static" modifier.


Ex:
class Maths
{
    public   const int VALUE = 10;
    public readonly int MAX = 10;

    public Maths(int max)
    {
        MAX = max;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Maths.VALUE);

        Maths maths = new Maths(902);
        Console.WriteLine(maths.MAX);
      //  maths.MAX = 29;
    }
}


Set private or protected access to the "accessors" of property.
----------------------------------------------------------------
You can set private or protected access to either "get" or "set" but not both.

 public int Roll {get;private set;}
or
 public int Roll {private get;set;}
Or
 public int Roll
  {
     private get
      { ... }
     set {}
   }
